This is demo for the idea developed during PerkinsHack, a hackathon dedicated to help solved problems faced by the visually impaired community using technology. It was also the winning project for the problem presented below.

#### The challenge presented was:
Privacy, Please!
Challenge
Completing personal medical forms shouldnâ€™t involve the rest of the waiting room.  
Jerry's story: 
>"Recently I went to a new dentist and was told I needed to fill out a whole sheaf of forms. I have an app on my iPhone that will read text out loud if I take a picture of it, but there was no way I could fill out the paper forms without help.
Fortunately, one of the staff sat with me for half an hour, asking me all sorts of personal questions, and completed the forms for me in the waiting room. I was glad there were no other patients in the room at the time.
It made me uncomfortable to have a total stranger fill out forms for me, especially in a public place like a waiting room. I wish there was a better solution."

#### Solution:
Instead of needing help from medical staffs, the users can use their mobile device to take a photo of the form. This form can then be converted to text and to voice which enables users to use headphone/earphone to fill out the form. The program will stop when it encounters a field needed to be filled. The users can speak or type to fill. The information that they filled in can be saved on their devices if they want to. It can be reused for future forms. For example: Name, Birthday, Address, and many others medical or non-medical questions. Ideally, the users won't need to fill out the same form twice, or spending too much time on different forms because most of the answers are there!!!

##### Can the user use mobile devices?
Yes, they can. Possibly better than I do. They can also ask the medical staffs to take a photo for them. 


#### Future Improvements:
The ImageToText and speechToText API don't work sometimes. It depends on the photos' quality and the users' pronunciation. It also needs to be able to work on mobile devices and not on a webpage using javascript and html. :)

### Other than that, this is a demonstration for a hackathon that was done in 24 hours. It surely has a lot of flaws. However, this is a topic that I am interested in and would like to continue to work on as a side project.
